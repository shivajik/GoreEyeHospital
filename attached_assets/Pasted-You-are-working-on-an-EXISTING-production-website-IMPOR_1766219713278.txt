You are working on an EXISTING production website.
IMPORTANT: Do NOT break or refactor existing features, routes, styles, or layouts unless explicitly required.

TASK OVERVIEW:
Enhance the existing “Our Services” section of the website with individual service pages, human-written content, images, and full SEO/AEO/GEO optimization.

STEP 1: ANALYZE EXISTING IMPLEMENTATION
- Scan the current codebase.
- Identify:
  - Existing “Our Services” page or section
  - Current service list (names, routes, data source)
  - Routing pattern (App Router / Pages Router)
  - Existing SEO utilities or metadata handling
- Reuse existing patterns wherever possible.

STEP 2: SERVICE PAGES CREATION
For EACH service listed under “Our Services”:
- Create an individual service detail page
- Follow existing routing and folder conventions
- URL structure example:
  /services/cataract-surgery
  /services/laser-vision-correction
  /services/glaucoma-treatment
  /services/retina-care
  /services/pediatric-eye-care

Each service page must include:
1. Hero section
   - Service name
   - One-line benefit-driven headline
   - Relevant service image (use optimized placeholder if real image not available)

2. Detailed Content Sections (Human Tone)
   - What is this service?
   - Who needs this treatment?
   - How the procedure works (simple, non-medical tone)
   - Benefits for patients
   - When to consult a doctor
   - Safety & technology used

IMPORTANT CONTENT RULES:
- Content must sound human-written
- Use natural sentence variations
- Avoid robotic repetition
- Use conversational explanations
- Write as an experienced eye-care professional explaining to a patient
- Google should NOT detect it as AI-written content

STEP 3: IMAGES
- Add at least:
  - 1 hero image per service
  - 2 supporting section images
- Use:
  - next/image for optimization
  - SEO-friendly alt text including service + location
    Example:
    “Cataract surgery treatment at eye hospital in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar”

STEP 4: SEO OPTIMIZATION (MANDATORY)
For every service page:
- Dynamic <title> including:
  Service Name + City
  Example:
  “Cataract Surgery in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar | [Hospital Name]”

- Meta description:
  - 150–160 characters
  - Include service + location + benefit

- Proper heading hierarchy:
  - One H1 only
  - Logical H2 and H3 structure

- Internal linking:
  - Link back to Services page
  - Link to related services
  - Link to Contact / Appointment page

STEP 5: GEO OPTIMIZATION
- Naturally include:
  - City: Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar / Aurangabad
  - Area / locality references (if available)
- Add NAP consistency where relevant
- Embed Google Map on main Services page (if not already present)

STEP 6: AEO (ANSWER ENGINE OPTIMIZATION)
For EACH service page:
- Add an FAQ section (4–6 questions)
- Questions should match real user queries, such as:
  - “Is cataract surgery safe?”
  - “How long does laser eye surgery take?”
  - “Is this treatment painful?”

- Implement FAQ Schema (JSON-LD)
- Answers must be:
  - Short
  - Clear
  - Voice-search friendly

STEP 7: SCHEMA & STRUCTURED DATA
- Add or extend:
  - MedicalBusiness / LocalBusiness schema
  - Service schema where applicable
- Ensure schema does NOT duplicate existing markup

STEP 8: PERFORMANCE & QUALITY CHECK
- Ensure:
  - No broken routes
  - No SEO metadata conflicts
  - Images are optimized
  - Mobile responsiveness maintained
  - Lighthouse SEO score improvement

STEP 9: FINAL VERIFICATION
Before finishing:
- Verify that all service pages are accessible
- Confirm content feels human and educational
- Ensure SEO, AEO, and GEO signals are properly implemented
- Confirm existing website behavior remains unchanged

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
- Enhanced Services page
- Individual service pages
- Human-written content
- SEO-ready metadata
- FAQ schema & local optimization
- Zero regression in existing functionality
